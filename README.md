# Milano Smart Park Firmware for Arduino IDE

A&A Milano Smart Park Project

Firmware developed with the Arduino IDE by Norman Mulinacci @ 2021

The project runs on Espressif's ESP32-DevkitC with ESP32-WROVER-B module

## Building and flashing from source (using the Arduino IDE):

### Required Core (you can also download it through the Arduino IDE):

- [Arduino core for the ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)
    + To download the core through the Arduino IDE, you need to add the following URLs in File -> Settings -> Additional URLs:
    https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json, http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

### Required external libraries (you can also download them through the Arduino IDE):

- [U8g2 Arduino library](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino)
- [SSLClient Library](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/SSLClient)
- [BSEC Arduino library](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BSEC-Arduino-library)
	+ In order for the linker to work properly, you need to perform the modifications described in the BSEC page. They work fine in Arduino IDE v1.8.13.
- [PMS Library](https://github.com/fu-hsi/pms)
- [MiCS6814-I2C-Library](https://github.com/eNBeWe/MiCS6814-I2C-Library)

### Build settings (under the Tools tab):

- Board: "ESP32 Dev Module" (under ESP32 Arduino)
- Upload Speed: "921600"
- CPU Frequency: "240MHz (WiFi/BT)"
- Flash Frequency: "80MHz"
- Flash Mode: "QIO"
- Flash Size: "4MB (32Mb)"
- Partition Scheme: "Default 4MB with spiffs (1.2MB APP/1.5MB SPIFFS)"
- Core Debug Level: "None"
- PSRAM: "Enabled"

## Flashing from binary releases (Windows instructions):

1. Connect the ESP32 board to a USB port on your PC. Check that it's been detected correctly:
   it should appear as "Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COMx)".
   If not, download the drivers manually: 
	+ for Windows 10: https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver.zip
	+ for older Windows versions: https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/CP210x_Windows_Drivers.zip
	
2. Extract the "esptool_win" folder from the zip file.

3. Run "RUNME.BAT". The script will automatically scan for the right COM port and then erase, flash and verify the board.
   If it stays on "Connecting..." for too long, try again on a different USB port.

4. If it verifies OK, you are done!
